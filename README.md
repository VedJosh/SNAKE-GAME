# Snake Game üêç

This is a simple **Snake Game** created using the Python `turtle` graphics library. The player controls the snake to eat food, grow, and avoid hitting the walls or itself. The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which affect the speed of the snake.

## Features:
- **Game Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- **Snake Movement**: Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
- **Food**: The snake grows in length every time it eats the food, and the score increases.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the current score at the top and shows "GAME OVER" when the game ends.

## How to Play:
1. Run the script to start the game.
2. When prompted, choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake:
   - `Up`: Move the snake up.
   - `Down`: Move the snake down.
   - `Left`: Move the snake left.
   - `Right`: Move the snake right.
4. Eat the blue food to grow and increase your score.
5. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
